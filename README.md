Hi I'm @DonglunHe

I believe myself to be an inspired computer science student, currently enrolled in the MCIT program at UPenn, who strives to make a positive difference inside and outside the tech world. Equipped with proficient programming skills, deep knowledge on interdisciplinary social studies, and extensive hands-on experience with consumer electronics, I am more than ready to design, code and implement the latest and greatest features across different platforms.

Besides technical skills, I adapt quickly to fast-paced working environment, actively collaborate with team members, and take pride and responsibility in what I create. In addition, I am always passionate about learning new skills and technologies for better solutions. I am confident to bring not only extraordinary experience to the user, but also great contribution to the team.
